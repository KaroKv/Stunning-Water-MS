// Plant monitoring system

/*
Description of the code:
This code is meant for the Plant monitoring system.
The LED lights will function as a feedback from the system
and are supposed to be green, yellow and red. Just like a traffic light.
The LED-lights are connected in this manner:
Red = Pin ? (not decided)
Yellow = Pin ? 
Green = Pin ? 

*/

// Constants

int LEDred = ?;
int LEDyellow = ?;
int LEDgreen = ?;

int TVm = 40; //Minimum treshold value for soil moisture, unknown
int TVmax = 70; //Maximum treshold value for soil moisture, unknown


void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(115200); // Defining Baud rate. 115200 baud is chosen.
  
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

digitalWrite(LEDred, HIGH); // Turn on if feedback of an error is necessary
digitalWrite(LEDyellow, HIGH);// Turn on if the treshold values has been reached.
digitalWrite(LEDgreen, HIGH); //Turn on if the program does not find anything wrong.
